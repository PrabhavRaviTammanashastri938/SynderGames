This is a very important Note.

You need to install certain Node Modules from NPM.

So follow these commands before writing your code

1. npm i mongoose
2. npm i express
3. npm i bcrypt
4. npm i ejs

After running these commands , make sure your dependancies appear like this ( based on your current version) in the package JSON file:
{
  "dependencies": {
    "bcrypt": "^5.1.1",
    "ejs": "^3.1.9",
    "express": "^4.18.3",
    "mongoose": "^8.2.0"
  }
}
